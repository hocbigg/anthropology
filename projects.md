# Projects

This page is a curated collection of well-written, step-by-step guides for learning Anthropology through hands-on, project-based practice.

> *What I cannot create, I do not understand — Richard Feynman.*

These projects are meant to support learning throughout the curriculum, not only at the end.  
By building, writing, creating, or reconstructing real artifacts in the field, learners develop practical understanding alongside theoretical study.
