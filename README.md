# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum in Anthropology, condensed into 1 year of study at approximately 20 hours per week.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.
