# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced program equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate foundation in Anthropology, condensed into 1–2 years assuming approximately 20 hours per week of dedicated study.

Anthropology explores human diversity across time and space through its four main subfields: 

- Cultural anthropology (social and cultural practices)
- Biological anthropology (human evolution and variation)
- Archaeology (material remains of past societies)
- Linguistic anthropology (language in social contexts).

The program balances theoretical knowledge, methodological skills, and practical application, emphasizing critical thinking about human societies, evolution, and cultural dynamics.

The structure is divided into four phases: 

- **Introductory** (orientation and fundamentals, ~3–4 months)
- **Core** (essential subjects building depth, ~6–9 months)
- **Advanced** (specialization tracks with electives, ~4–6 months)
- **Capstone** (synthesis and application, ~2–3 months).

**After Introductory**: Achieve a broad understanding of anthropology's subfields and basic concepts; self-assess via reflective essays on human diversity.

**After Core**: Gain proficiency in methods and theory; milestone includes a mock research proposal integrating subfields.

Specialization tracks allow deeper focus in one subfield while maintaining interdisciplinary breadth. Tracks include:

- **Cultural Anthropology**: Emphasizes social structures, ethnography, and contemporary issues like globalization.
- **Biological Anthropology**: Focuses on human biology, evolution, and primatology.
- **Archaeology**: Centers on material culture, excavation techniques, and historical interpretation.
- **Linguistic Anthropology**: Explores language as a cultural tool, semiotics, and sociolinguistics.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
