# Summary

This curriculum is oriented toward cultivating an anthropological mode of inquiry rather than the accumulation of factual knowledge about particular societies. Its central epistemic aim is to develop sensitivity to context, comparison, and interpretation: the ability to understand human practices as situated within social relations, symbolic systems, material conditions, and historical trajectories.

The curriculum is structured to reflect anthropology’s internal organization as a holistic discipline. It begins by establishing a unified frame of reference, then introduces the interpretive frameworks and methodological foundations that make anthropological knowledge possible. From there, it moves through the major analytical domains through which anthropologists study humanity—social relations, language, biology, material remains—without treating these as independent silos. The sequence culminates in comparative reasoning, which draws together insights from across the curriculum and clarifies how anthropological understanding extends beyond single cases.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

# Curriculum

Study all 8 subjects below, in roughly the presented order, using either the suggested textbook or the online course, but ideally both.

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| ------- | ---------- | ---- | ------ |
| Introduction to Anthropology | Establishes what anthropology is, how it differs from related disciplines, and how its subfields fit together as a unified approach to studying humanity. | [_Perspectives: An Open Invitation to Cultural Anthropology_](https://perspectives.americananthro.org/) | [MIT OpenCourseWare: Introduction to Anthropology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/21a-00-introduction-to-anthropology-spring-2022/) |
| Anthropological Theory | Develops the ability to interpret ethnographic and archaeological material through explicit conceptual frameworks rather than commonsense assumptions. | [_Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History_](https://mahabubjnu.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/anthropological_theory__an_introductory_history__fourth_edition_.pdf) | [MIT OpenCourseWare: Anthropological Theory](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/21a-110-anthropological-theory-spring-2003/) |
| Ethnographic Methods | Explains how anthropological knowledge about living societies is produced through long-term, situated research rather than casual observation. | [_Perspectives: An Open Invitation to Cultural Anthropology_](https://perspectives.americananthro.org/) | [MIT OpenCourseWare: Ethnography](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sts-360-ethnography-spring-2003/) |
| Social and Cultural Anthropology | Provides systematic ways to analyze social organization, meaning, and cultural variation across societies. | [_Perspectives: An Open Invitation to Cultural Anthropology_](https://perspectives.americananthro.org/) | [FutureLearn: Introducing Anthropology: Cultures and Societies](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/cultures-societies-introducing-anthropology) |
| Linguistic Anthropology | Examines language as a social practice, revealing how communication, power, and identity are intertwined. | [_Language, Culture, and Society_](https://archive.org/details/languagecultures0000salz_a9b5) | [Coursera: Miracles of Human Language: An Introduction to Linguistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-language) |
| Biological Anthropology | Situates human cultural life within biological evolution and variation without reducing culture to biology. | [_Essentials of Biological Anthropology_](https://archive.org/details/essentialsofphys0000lars) | [Biological Anthropology - Alivia Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDtERbGOCsM9TL4FyQLhNg2eA8PQtYjSq) |
| Archaeological Anthropology | Introduces material evidence as a source for understanding past human societies and long-term social change. | [_Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice_](https://www.amazon.com/Archaeology-Theories-Practice-Colin-Renfrew/dp/0500849986) | [FutureLearn: Archaeology: from Dig to Lab and Beyond](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/archaeology) |
| Comparative Anthropology | Trains comparative reasoning, allowing learners to relate cases across time and space without collapsing differences. | | [Comparative Anthropology](coursepages/comparative-anthropology.md) |

## Note

This curriculum does not cover applied anthropology, development studies, medical anthropology, or policy-oriented research, as these areas presuppose a solid theoretical and methodological foundation. Advanced debates in poststructuralist theory, quantitative modeling, and specialized archaeological science require higher levels of academic training and technical expertise than intended here. The program also does not aim to provide regional specialization; focused study of particular societies should follow, not precede, conceptual grounding.
